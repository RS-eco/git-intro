## What is Git?

## What is Git?

Git is an **Open Source Distributed Version Control System**.

*  tracks changes in "any set of files"

*  multiple people can add and edit code in parallel

--

*   Git has a **remote repository** which is stored on a server
*   and a **local repository** which is stored on the computer of each developer. 

--

This means that the code is not just stored on a central server, but a full copy of the code and its history is present on each of the developers’ computers.

---

## Getting started

Git itself is a version control system that can be installed on any server. 

However, we’ll be using Github (https://github.com), as a remote Git repository.

--

Key features provided by GitHub include:

.pull-left[
*   Issues
*   Discussions
*   Pull requests
*   Notifications
]

.pull-right[
*   Labels
*   Actions
*   Forks
*   Projects
]

For more details and some good instructions, see: https://guides.github.com/

---

## Registration

If you have not done so, go to https://github.com/ and create an account.

--

### Student Developer Pack

It is strongly recommended that you get a free “student” account. 

A normal, free GitHub account does not allow you to create “private” repositories, 
while a student account allows you up to 5 private repositories.

**Unless you use a private repository, any code you push to GitHub is automatically public and accessible by anyone.**

In order to extend your account to a student account, go to https://education.github.com/pack and register for a “student pack”, after you have registered for a normal account.´

### **Don't do this now, but after our session!**

## Installing Git on Your Machine

If you want to use Git on your own personal machine, then you may need to install a Git client. 

There are many options out there and you are encouraged to explore them.

Git has released its own graphical user interface clients which are available for free
for both Windows and Mac:

*  Windows: https://windows.github.com/
*  Mac: https://mac.github.com

**Matt will show you how to use this later on.**

## Basic procedure

### 1.  Create remote repository
### 2.  Create local repository
### 3.  Stage file(s)
### 4.  Commit file(s)
### 5.  Push commit

---

## Basic procedure

### 1. Create remote repository

After registering in the GitHub homepage:

1.  In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click and then select "New repository".
1.  Give the repository a name and optionally also a description
1.  Choose if the repository should be "public" or "private"
1.  Add README, .gitignore and license
1.  click “Create Repository”

--

**Note:** Apart from step one, all other steps can be easily done in **RStudio**. And I'll show you how to do this after the presentation.

### 2. Create your local Git repository

*  Basically this means that you download the created remote repository to your local machine.

---

## Basic procedure

### 3. Stage file(s)

*  Adding files to the index of the repository

--

### 4. Commit file(s)

*  Commit means to register the changes you have made, so that others can eventually see them, too.
*  Alway add an "Update message" to your commit.
*  The "Update message" should be as descriptive as possible, so you are able to find certain changes later on.

--

### 5. Push commit

*  With push you upload your changes to the main branch in the local repository to the main branch in the remote repository.
*  Thus, **only after this is a copy of your changes are stored on the server**.

---

## Other commands

### Pull

*  Pull is used to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository. 
*  If multiple people work on one repository, the remote repository is updated continuously by various people, hence git pull is necessary.

--

### Clone

*  Cloning is used to clone an existing remote repository into your computer.

--

### Fork

*  Forking is the process of creating a copy of a repository from another user.
*  When a user forks a repository, all the files in the repository are copied to the user’s account on GitHub.
*  This process is similar to copying a folder from one drive to another drive in a computer. 

---

## Other commands

### Branching

*  Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
*  The default branch, which is created when you initialize a repository, is commonly named **main**. 
*  We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.
*  The head of the current branch is named HEAD. 
*  Branches are an incredibly useful feature of Git because it supports multiple parallel development, which can automatically be merged into the default branch later on.

## Other commands

### Merging

With merge you can bring the changes implemented within a sub-branch back to your **main** branch.
